👋 Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a seasoned JavaScript developer with a passion for crafting engaging user experiences. My journey in web development has been fueled by a love for exploring the latest in frontend technologies and leveraging them to build intuitive interfaces.

**About Me**

🚀 I have extensive experience working with Angular, Vue, and React

🔧 While my primary focus is on frontend development, I'm also proficient in Codigniter and Laravel (PHP), enabling me to deliver comprehensive solutions to my clients.

🏠 When I'm not at work, you can often find me immersed in coding for my smart home projects - I've even integrated my car! Check out my Homebridge repositories to see what I've been up to.
